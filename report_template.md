# Project Description
Recycled Corp is a world leader in recycling and we have just conducted a
study in why people are not recycling. Our idea is an application that can
help people to scan products via barcode (Or type it in) and see which
products can be recycled, how and where to recycle them. We also want to
reward the user for recycling so some nice messages would be good!

The application will be called Recycle Rush and will target Android versions
4.0.3 (Ice Cream Sandwich) and later. The primary programming language will
be Java.

The git repository can be found at https://github.com/IT-Kakan/adp_project

The issue tracker can be found at https://trello.com/b/xZWxyu2J/agile-development-processes

The continuous integration builds cab be found at https://travis-ci.org/IT-Kakan/adp_project

# Sprint 1 Log

## Commitment

- Fill backlog with possible features
- Select one spokesperson in the group
- Create a HelloWorld application (Initialize Android project)
- Create and upload a first report
- Implement Travis continuous integration

## Work Done

Feature | Time estimated | Time spent per team member
--------|----------------|--------
Set up the project environment | 12 hours | Kalayu: 2 hours, Johan: 2 hours, Mahshid: 2 hours, Emil: 2 hours, Jesper O: 2 hours, Jesper R: 2 hours  
Filled the backlog and met with the customer | 6 hours | Kalayu: 1 hour, Johan: 1 hour, Mahshid: 1 hour, Emil: 1 hour, Jesper O: 1 hour, Jesper R: 1 hour
Initialised the report | 40 mins | Jesper O: 40 mins
Initialised the Android Project | 20 mins | Johan: 20 mins
Set up Travis-CI | 20 mins | Jesper O: 20 mins

## Reflections
There is not much to reflect on, as this was not a typical development sprint. We met for the first time and set up the basis for the project. We were successful in splitting the work between us and managed to complete all assigned tasks.

Given the atypical nature of this sprint, we have chosen to not reflect on agile practices. However, we have made knowledge transfer within the group, as we had different experiance on setting up of the basis of the project.

# Sprint 2 Log
Per sprint, fill out one sprint log section and its subsections.

## Commitment
List the features/stories that the team committed to finish during the sprint.

## Work Done
Log what was accomplished, and how.
Please report on all activities; for example, in addition to coding, planning and design discussion.

Feature | Time estimated | Time spent per team member
--------|----------------|--------
Acceptance test 1 | 3 hours 30 mins | Kalayu: 30 mins, Johan: 30 mins, Mahshid: 30 mins, Tom: 30 mins, Emil: 30 mins, Jesper O: 30 mins, Jesper R: 30 mins
Planning | 6 hours 10 mins | Kalayu: 50 mins, Johan: 50 mins, Mahshid: 50 mins, Tom: 50 mins, Emil: 50 mins, Jesper O: 50 mins, Jesper R: 50 mins

# Sprint X Log
Per sprint, fill out one sprint log section and its subsections.

## Commitment
List the features/stories that the team committed to finish during the sprint.

## Work Done
Log what was accomplished, and how.
Please report on all activities; for example, in addition to coding, planning and design discussion.

Feature | Time estimated | Time spent per team member
--------|----------------|--------
*Name and ID of each feature* | *X hours* | *Member A: Y hours, Member B: Z hours*

## Reflections
Reflect on how the work worked.
This data will form the basis for your final reflection.
As the postmortem will be a writeup, it's fine to use shorthand notes, bullet list, and similar.
Keep within 1000-1500 words.

Discuss any deviations from the sprint commitment.

Reflect on the agile practice practiced:

- Did your experience correspond to or contradict with what literature claims?

    - Analysis of why. Mostly interesting if something unexpected happens, but even
      if everything runs according to plan, reflecting on the underlying mechanisms
      can be interesting.

- How did the practices interact?
  Did they complement or counteract each other?

- How efficient were the practices, given the time they took to use?

# Postmortem
Once the project is finished, summarize your experiences.
The postmortem part shall be 2000-3000 words long.

Considering the following:

- With regards to the agile practices, reflect on the combined experience from all sprints.

- Which practices had the most impact on the software developed?
  Think of both positives and negatives.

- What would you do differently in a future but similar project?


# Project outcome
Document the project, for example using screenshots.
