This is the project report template.
Fill it out over the course of the project.

# Project Description
Include the project description from the assignment,
your chosen target platform,
programming language,
and a name for the software.

Link to your:

- git repository
- issue tracker
- continuous integration builds

# Sprint 1 Log
Per sprint, fill out one sprint log section and its subsections.

## Commitment
List the features/stories that the team committed to finish during the sprint.

## Work Done
Log what was accomplished, and how.
Please report on all activities; for example, in addition to coding, planning and design discussion.

Feature | Time estimated | Time spent per team member
--------|----------------|--------
*Name and ID of each feature* | *X hours* | *Member A: Y hours, Member B: Z hours*

## Reflections
Reflect on how the work worked.
This data will form the basis for your final reflection.
As the postmortem will be a writeup, it's fine to use shorthand notes, bullet list, and similar.
Keep the reflection part within 500 1000-words (per sprint).

Discuss any deviations from the sprint commitment.

Reflect on the agile practice practiced:

- What worked well?

- What can be improved?

- What changes will you do for the next sprint?


# Sprint X Log
*As for the previous sprints.*


# Postmortem
Once the project is finished, summarize your experiences.
The postmortem part of the final report shall be within 1500-2000 words.

Considering the following:

- With regards to the agile practices, reflect on the combined experience from all sprints.
  Did your experience correspond to or contradict with what literature claims?

    - Analysis of why. Mostly interesting if something unexpected happens, but even
      if everything runs according to plan, reflecting on the underlying mechanisms
      can be interesting.

- Which practices had the most impact on the software developed?
  Think of both positives and negatives.

- How did you manage dependencies towards other teams?

    - What particular challenges did you encounter?


# Project outcome
Document the project, for example using screenshots.
