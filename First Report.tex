Agile Development Processes Project Report
Team 2

Fredrik Burhöi Bengtsson
Miray Iyidogan
Filip Lindahl
Tingting Liu
Kevin Rasku
Florian Stellbrink

This is the project report template.
Fill it out over the course of the project.

# Project Description
Include the project description from the assignment,
your chosen target platform,
programming language,
and a name for the software.

Link to your:

- git repository
- issue tracker
- continuous integration builds

# Sprint 1 Log
Per sprint, fill out one sprint log section and its subsections.

## Commitment
List the features/stories that the team committed to finish during the sprint.

## Work Done
Log what was accomplished, and how.
Please report on all activities; for example, in addition to coding, planning and design discussion.

Feature | Time estimated | Time spent per team member
--------|----------------|--------
*Name and ID of each feature* | *X hours* | *Member A: Y hours, Member B: Z hours*

## Reflections
Reflect on how the work worked.
This data will form the basis for your final reflection.
As the postmortem will be a writeup, it's fine to use shorthand notes, bullet list, and similar.
Keep within 1000-1500 words.

Discuss any deviations from the sprint commitment.

Reflect on the agile practice practiced:

- Did your experience correspond to or contradict with what literature claims?

    - Analysis of why. Mostly interesting if something unexpected happens, but even
      if everything runs according to plan, reflecting on the underlying mechanisms
      can be interesting.

- How did the practices interact?
  Did they complement or counteract each other?

- How efficient were the practices, given the time they took to use?


# Sprint X Log
*As for the previous sprints.*


# Postmortem
Once the project is finished, summarize your experiences.
The postmortem part shall be 2000-3000 words long.

Considering the following:

- With regards to the agile practices, reflect on the combined experience from all sprints.

- Which practices had the most impact on the software developed?
  Think of both positives and negatives.

- What would you do differently in a future but similar project?


# Project outcome
Document the project, for example using screenshots.

\section{Project Description}
SpaceY is a visionary company that launches rocket shaped objects into space. We often have to type in a lot of rocket calculations into spreadsheets which requires us to memorise them. Therefore we are looking for someone to create an app which stores rocketry equations and lets us type in the required values so we can validate the spreadsheets. This should be a very simple application with a strong focus on the UX.

\subsection{Target platform}
A web-application that is primarily used on a desktop but that is also designed to work on mobile devices.

\subsection{Programming language}
Javascript (React) for the frontend, and ASP.NET Core for the backend.

\subsection{Name of the software}
SpaceY Equation App.
\section{Sprint 1 Log}
\subsection{Commitment}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Set up a communication channel
    \item Brainstorming for initial requirements
    \item Initial meeting with customer/coach
    \item Set up git environment
    \item Set up issue tracker
    \item Create initial backlog
    \item Create hello world application
    \item Prepare first report
\end{itemize}

\end{table}


\subsection{Reflections}
For the first meeting, we had a brainstorming session to figure out some of the main requirements of our project. Later, We created a Slack channel for communications, agreed on technologies that are going to be used, set up the report and prepared the environment on Github and related services.\\
Since this sprint was short and focused on getting started, there were no deviations from the sprint commitment.

\subsection{Reflections}

In the beginning of this sprint, we had a meeting where we planned out the sprint and assigned tasks. We also needed to discuss the technical details of the project since different people within the group had different levels of previous experience with this type of development. The group was divided into 3 smaller groups that were each assigned to a task in the sprint backlog.

During the sprint,  the 3 different groups worked together on their task. It did also take a fair amount of time to get familiar with the code base and languages that we chose to work with. There were some scheduling issues, in terms of finding time where the different group members could meet and work together. This was also impacted by the lectures scheduled during the workshops this week.

In terms of agile principles, we discussed which ones we wanted to use in this sprint or the next. For this sprint we did have collective code ownership since everyone was working with the same code collectively. We want to try to use more pair programming in the next sprint, also one member of the group expressed an interest in being the scrum master. 

Looking at the sprint commitment, there were some things that we could have broken down into smaller pieces. If we look at the task about verifying the equations, the user story we had in the sprint backlog was the following: \textit{"As a user (rocket scientist) I want the equations to be verified and trustworthy because it is important that they are correct."} When we broke down the sub-tasks involved in this, we realized that in order to verify an equation we must be able to evaluate it. When evaluating equations, we also want to be able to edit the equations. In order to have equations to edit we must also be able to enter equations. We also needed to figure out if we needed to automate the verification of the equations and if it would need to involve any third party. 

In that sense we deviated from what the sprint commitment explicitly said, since this particular commitment needed other things to be done in order to fulfill it. It could have been split into smaller pieces that are easier to estimate and implement in the time-span of a sprint.
